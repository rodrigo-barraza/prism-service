/**
 * Tool pinning — the defense against MCP "rug-pulls".
 *
 * A server can change a tool's description or schema after the owner has
 * looked at it; the changed text then reaches the model with the trust the
 * original earned. Poisoned descriptions succeed 69.5% of the time
 * (arXiv 2608.23763), and fragmenting the payload across description,
 * schema and annotations beats single-channel checks (arXiv 2609.18217), so
 * the fingerprint covers all of them at once.
 *
 * When the owner approves a server, each tool's fingerprint is pinned. A
 * tool whose fingerprint later differs, or that did not exist at approval,
 * is quarantined: hidden from the model and refused if called, until the
 * owner approves it again.
